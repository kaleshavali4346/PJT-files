Skin cancer, notably melanoma, is a growing concern, particularly among young individuals[6], due to costly and delayed conventional diagnostic methods[1]. Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have emerged as promising solutions. Previous research, including the use of models like VGG16, has shown the potential of AI in skin cancer detection[2,8]. This study combines VGG16 feature extraction with machine learning models like XGBoost and LightGBM, holding promise for accurate skin cancer classification and early diagnosis[2,4].
	In the realm of skin disease detection, recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly enhanced diagnostic reliability[7]. The ISIC 2019 dataset showcases the potential of DNNs, empowered by parallel processing and cloud computing[5]. Strategies like dimensionality reduction are crucial for handling irregularities in skin cancer datasets[9,15]. Densenet169, guided by Bayesian optimization, demonstrates exceptional accuracy among various CNN architectures[4]. The PECK approach, which integrates deep networks, SVMs, and random forests, enhances boundary definition in challenging scenarios[3]. These innovations point towards a promising future of improved skin cancer diagnosis through deep learning, potentially leading to better patient outcomes[9].
